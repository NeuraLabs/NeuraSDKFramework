# Neura SDK

## Getting Started

- **[CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org)**
    - Make sure you are running the latest version of CocoaPods by running:
      ```bash
      gem install cocoapods
      # (or if the above fails)
      sudo gem install cocoapods
      ```
    - Update your local specs repo by running:
      ```bash
      pod update
      ```
      _This step is optional, if you updated the specs repo recently._

    - Add the following line to your Podfile:
    
      ```ruby
      pod 'NeuraSDKFramework'
      ```

    - Run `pod install`
    - You are all set!
